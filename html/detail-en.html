            In middle school, I was far from a serious student.<br>
            However, because I was worried about my future, I studied very hard.
             but I failed the high school entrance exam and ultimately enrolled in my second-choice public high school.<br>
        </p>  

        <p class="content1-1"> 
            In high school, I could not fit in with my classmates because of my strong personality. <br>
            For that reason,I started to feel uncomfortable living in Japan, and that made me interested in going abroad.<br>
            I decided to study overseas in university.However, studying abroad costs a lot of money.<br>
            My family was not rich, so I thought the best choice was to go to a national or public university,
            and join an exchange program.<br>
             I found out that good universities have exchange programs with strong universities outside Japan,<br>
             so I applied to Kobe University, which is well known for business studies in Japan.<br> but I failed the entrance exam and had to study for one more year.<br>
        </p>
        
        <p class="content1-1"> 
           During my gap year, I started thinking seriously about my future and began to research studying abroad.<br>
           Because of money problems, I never thought about full-time study abroad.<br>
            But then I found out that Hungary has a scholarship program<br>
             that covers tuition fees and also provides housing support and living expenses.<br>
            So I decided to go to a university in Hungary.
            <br>Because thanks to the scholarship, it does not cost that much money!!<br>
          In high school, I liked mathematics, and I was also worried about my future. <br>
          For these reasons, I decided to study computer science.<br>
           That is how I ended up where I am today.<br>

            I could talk more, but you might be disappointed, so I’ll stop here.😒<br>

    <p class="bigexplain">Explanation</p>

    <p class="Explain">
     At university, I study Computer Science in English. 
     Although Hungarian is the official language in Hungary,but
      my classmates come from many different countries, and our classes are taught in English. 
      Because of that, I am happy to live my daily life using English.
     Although many of the subjects are very difficult, I can pass the classes and earn credits. 
     However, sometimes I do not clearly understand
      what I am doing or how it will be useful in the real world 😂<br>
